# About this:

Anyone else, but it is more convenient for me to control the mouse, but because of this it is impossible, to quickly call the map.
I decided to correct this injustice. Now players, who prefer a mouse, can also calling the map to TAB button

he program simulates clicking in the desired area to call the map and returns the cursor back.
The source code of the program is attached.
Unfortunately, this program only works on Full HD monitors, since I have no right to interfere with the source code of the game.

How to use:
1. Launch the game in FULL screen mode (1920*1080p resolution).
2. Launch the program (press Win + D to minimize all windows, including the game).
3. Enjoy. TAB key now to open map.
